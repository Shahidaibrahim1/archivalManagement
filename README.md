# archivalManagement
Archival Management is an important software solution for any department, because every department has tons of paper work,
whether in soft or hard. And managing those papers are not very easy and most of the time efficient. With a system like archival
management, you can create any paper work you like with ease according to your department template as well as manage and print them.
Searching through any document created is also very easy. Any organization needs organizing its important files in a structured manner.
Banul - my partner in this project - and myself has created this repository to help developers further add into it and create a complete
and sophisticated solution which any organization/department can use. 
We have used flask for the back-end and html, css and a little bit of JS for the  front-end.
Thank you so much.
